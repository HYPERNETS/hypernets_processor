"""
Database schema specification for Hypernets land and water network
"""

# The set of defined processor schema is defined below in DB_DICT_DEFS. Each entry is the name of a defined schema
# format, the value is the schema definition.
#
# Each processor database schema is also defined below, in one of the two following ways:
#
# a. Dictionary definition
# ------------------------
#
# Each entry in the dictionary is the name of a table to be defined, the value of each entry is a dictionary that
# defines the table, it has the following entries:
#
# * "columns" - defines the table columns
#
#    each entry in the dictionary is the name of a column to be defined, the value of each entry is a dictionary that
#    defines the column, this has entries:
#
#    - "type" - defines the column type, value should be python type
#    - "foreign_key" (optional) - defines if column is foreign key to reference table. Value is dictionary structured
#      as: `{"reference_table": "<table_name>", "reference_column": "column_name"}`.
#      NB: This is not supported for defining sqlite databases. If this is required, please define as SQL command
#      (option b)
#    - other entries may be kwargs supported by dataset.table.Table.create_column
#
# * "primary_key" - defines the tables primary key, value is the column name.
# * other entries may be kwargs supported by dataset.database.Database.create_table
#
# b. SQL definition
# -----------------
#
# Databases may be defined with SQL commands as strings
#
#
# Database formats are defined following the specification defined in:
# Hypernets Team, Product Data Format Specification, v0.5 (2020)

# Metadata Database
METADATA_DB = {}

# Anolomy Database
ANOMOLY_DB = {}

# Archive Database
ARCHIVE_DB = {"products": {"columns": {"product_name": {"type": str},
                                       "raw_product_name": {"type": str},
                                       "site": {"type": str}
                                       }
                           }
