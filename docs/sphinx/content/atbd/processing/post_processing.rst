Post Processing - Site-specific Quality checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the L2A datasets have been produced, a final set of site-specific quality checks and masks are
applied. The site-specific quality checks and masks are determined after inspection of the first months of
data in consultation of the site owners. The resulting masks are applied to the L2A
dataset and stored as L2B. The same masks are also applied to the L1B datasets and stored as L1D. Only
the L1D and L2B data will be distributed to satellite validation users.

These post-processing quality checks are still under development and will be detailed here in the future.
