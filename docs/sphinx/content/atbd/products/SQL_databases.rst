SQL Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hypernets_processor produces SQL Database entries to keep track of successfully processed sequences and anomalies
in the processing. These entries are combined into an archive database (for successful sequences), an anomaly database
(for sequences with processing or quality issues), and a metadata database (which stores the relevant metadata for
the listings in the archive database). Each of these databases is stored in the SQLite format. These databases can be used to produce processing statistics, or to find a set of sequences/anomalies that
matched a certain set of criteria using SQL queries.


Archive Database
----------------------
SQLite database listing all succesfully processed data products, together with auxiliary information to enable queries
(product_name, datetime, sequence_name, site_id, system_id, product_level, product_path, rel_product_dir, sequence_path, 
latitude, longitude, solar_zenith_angle_min, solar_zenith_angle_max, solar_azimuth_angle_min, solar_azimuth_angle_max, 
viewing_zenith_angle_min, viewing_zenith_angle_max, viewing_azimuth_angle_min, viewing_azimuth_angle_max, percent_zero_flags).

Anomaly Database
----------------------
SQLite database recording occurrences of defined anomalies, e.g. incomplete sequence data, instrument failure etc.
(the different anomalies are listed on the :ref:`anomalies` page), together with auxiliary information to enable queries
(anomaly_id, sequence_name, sequence_path, site_id, datetime, rel_product_dir, product_level_last, product_path_last, 
solar_zenith_angle_min, solar_zenith_angle_max, solar_azimuth_angle_min, solar_azimuth_angle_max, viewing_zenith_angle_min, 
viewing_zenith_angle_max, viewing_azimuth_angle_min, viewing_azimuth_angle_max).

There are a number of anomalies that are defined to track where there are
issues in the processing of the data (e.g. incomplete sequence data, instrument failure etc). The
different anomalies are don the :ref:`anomalies` page. Each of the anomalies is identified with a
letter and every occurrence is stored in the Anomaly SQLite database, together with auxiliary information to enable queries (e.g. sequence name,
site id, datetime, viewing and solar angles, etc). Some of these anomalies will raise an error (e.g.
metadata file missing), and cause the processing of the data to be stopped. Other anomalies (e.g. clear
sky check failed) indicate an issue, but donâ€™t halt the processing of the data (e.g. measurements with
overcast conditions might still be useful to some users). In such cases, a quality flag is always added to
the data so that users can easily identify the affected sequences without having to look in the anomaly
database (see Section 3.3).

Metadata Database
----------------------
 SQLite database of all network metadata, e.g. site info, instrument info etc.
Contains all the metadata that is also present in the product files (stored in database to enable querying
this information).
