Bit #,name,network,level,Description,anomaly raised
20, single_skyradiance_used, W , L1C , If only one series of downwelling radiance is used for the computation of the reflectance  ,
21, lu_eq_missing, W , L1C , If there is no upwelling and downwelling radiance pair with similar pointing azimuth angles (within 1째 tolerance)  , `l'
22, rhof_angle_missing, W , L1C , If there is no downwelling radiance scans at the appropriate viewing zenith angle (i.e. 180째-$\theta_v$; within 1째 tolerance), `l'
23, rhof_default, W , L1C , If the viewing geometry of the upwelling and downwelling radiance measurements are outside the viewing geometry range of the selected LUT for the `rhof_option' (e.g. $\Delta\phi$ $>$ 180째 when using the LUT from \cite{Mobley1999}) a default $\rho_F$ is used for the air-water interface correction factor (default: $\rho_F$=0.0256)   ,
24, temp_variability_irr, W , L1C ,  If the difference in $E_d(\lambda)$ scans does not exceed a given threshold between two neighbouring scans (default: threshold = 25$\%$ and $\lambda$=550; see also \cite{Ruddick2006})  ,
25, temp_variability_rad, W , L1C ,  If the difference in $L_d(\lambda)$ or $L_u(\lambda)$ scans does not exceed a given threshold between two neighbouring scans (default: threshold = 25$\%$ and $\lambda$=550; see also \cite{Ruddick2006})  ,
26, min_nbred, W , L1C , If the total number of scans not flagged by either `nonlinearity'; `bad_pointing' or `outliers' is less than a given threshold (default: 3)  , `ned'
27, min_nbrlu, W , L1C , If the total number of scans not flagged by either `nonlinearity'; `bad_pointing' or `outliers' is less than a given threshold (default: 3)  , `nlu'
28, min_nblsky, W , L1C , If the total number of scans not flagged by either `nonlinearity'; `bad_pointing' or `outliers' is less than a given threshold (default: 3)  , `nld'
29, def_wind_flag, W , L1C , If a default wind speed is used (by default: wind speed = 2ms$^{-1}$) , 
30, simil_fail, W , L1C , If the quality check applied on the NIR similarity spectrum is not verified as suggested by \cite{ruddick2005} (see Section 3.2 and Fig. 4 in \cite{ruddick2005}) with default values for the computation of the NIR Similarity being 780 and 870~nm; the reference wavelength 670~nm and the threshold 5$\%$ ,
