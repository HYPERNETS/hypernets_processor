Metadata description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a range of metadata contained within the HYPERNETS product files.
For each variable, there is metadata such as the standard name,
long name, units and uncertainty components (where relevant).
The uncertainty variables will have additional metadata
describing their error correlation (see :ref:`uncertainty` and :ref:`using_hypernets`). Finally,
there is also a range of global metadata, describing
information about how, and when the data was processed,
what data files it used, information about the site (e.g.,
latitude and longitude) etc. The full list of global metadata fields is provided in Table 1.

**Table 1: Table of global metadata fields. The metadata listed as common are present in all product files**
