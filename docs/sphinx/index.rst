hypernets_processor: Hypernets water and land network data processor
====================================================================

The **hypernets_processor** module is a Python software package to process the `HYPERNETS <http://hypernets.eu/from_cms/summary>`_ land and water network in-situ hyperspectral data to surface reflectance products for distribution to users. The HYPERNETS project is funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 775983.

There are two main use cases for the **hypernets_processor** module. The primary function of the software is the automated preparation of data retrieved from network sites for distribution to users. Additionally, the software may also be used for ad-hoc processing of particular field acquisitions, for example for testing instrument operation in the field.

This documentation aimed at both users and developers of the software, find the relevant sections below.
